# Céu-Maker: Select device

![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/001/431/237/full/ceu-maker-select-device.png?1527049668)

A GUI application that shows up the connected Arduino boards and allows user to select one. It was developed to be used together with Céu-Maker's [make-arduino.bat](https://github.com/fsantanna/ceu-maker/blob/master/ceu-maker/run/make-arduino.bat) file as follows:

1. the ```make-arduino.bat``` is executed;
2. ```make-arduino.bat``` execute the ```SelectDevice.exe```;
3. in the oppened window, the user can:
    - **select a board: **in this case the ```SelectDevice.exe``` return to the ```make-arduino.bat``` a string containing the board, port, and if necessary, the cpu, separated by commas;
    - **choose to use the last selected board/port/cpu in Arduino IDE: **in this case the ```SelectDevice.exe``` return to the ```make-arduino.bat``` a string with the flag ```ide```. In practice, the ``make-arduino.bat``` will compile the code without --board and --port parameters. This may be a desirable behavior for a workaround solution, in the event that this application fails to recognize the board. This also may be useful if the end-user want to use a board from a diferent package or arch (currently, this program only recognizes boards from package "arduino" and arch "avr").

## Inspiration 
The Arduino IDE uses the file *arduino-1.8.3\hardware\arduino\avr\boards.txt* to identify ports and boards. With a VID/PID combination we can identify the USB device that is plugged and then search in this file for more information, such as name of the board.

## Dev notes
This app was developed using Visual Studio Community 2015 and only supports devices from package "arduino" and arch "avr".

### Create a new release version
To create a new release version, make sure to move the exe generated by the IDE from *SelectDevices/bin/Release/* to *ceu-maker/ceu-maker/run*

### #if DEBUG
In the [*SelectDevice/Form1.cs*](https://github.com/AnnyCaroline/ceu-maker-gsoc/blob/master/SelectDevice/SelectDevice/Form1.cs), we can find blocks of code using ```#if DEBUG```:

```
#if DEBUG
    string text = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(@"C:\Users\AnnyC\Desktop\ceu-maker\ceu-maker\arduino-1.8.3\hardware\arduino\avr\boards.txt");
#else
    string text = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(@"..\arduino-1.8.3\hardware\arduino\avr\boards.txt");
#endif
```
The above code was included to facilitate the location of *boards.txt* file in develop stage. If you're a developer, change the file path in the second line.  
For release, assume that the exe is located in the [same folder of *make-arduino.bat*](https://github.com/AnnyCaroline/ceu-maker/tree/master/ceu-maker/run). 

It's important to note that the application only closes in release mode. In debug we choose to omit this behavior to facilitate the tests.
