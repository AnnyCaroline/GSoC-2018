# Céu-Maker: easy-to-install, up-to-date integrated environment for Céu-Arduino and pico-Céu development

The objective of my proposal is to provide an easy-to-install, up-to-date integrated environment for Céu-Arduino and pico-Céu development. Céu is a synchronous reactive language, with supports concurrent lines of execution and broadcast communication through events. The environment issues events to the applications, with responds immediately. It’s recommended to interactive apps such as games, and targets from desktops to embedded systems. Exploring this last flexibility, the language has some variations, such as Céu-Arduino and pico-Céu, a version o Céu meanted to visual and interactive applications.

In the proposed approach, a developer can use the same source code to implement an application that runs on an Arduino (using Céu-Arduino) and on a computer (using pico-Céu), also supporting communicating between the two sides
