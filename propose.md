## BASICS
1. **What is your preferred e-mail address?**  
    [annycarolinegnr@gmail.com](mailto:annycarolinegnr@gmail.com)

2. **What is your web page / blog / github?**  
    [https://github.com/AnnyCaroline](https://github.com/AnnyCaroline)

3. **What is your academic background?**  
    I’m an undergraduate computer science student at the State University of Rio de Janeiro since 2014. I also have a scholarship for “Technological Initiation” since 2016.

4. **What other time commitments, such as school work, another job (GSoC is a full-time activity!), or planned vacations will you have during the period of GSoC?**  
    Only the ones mentioned in my academic background.

## EXPERIENCE
1. **What programming languages are you fluent in? Which tools do you normally use for development?**  
    I mostly use JavaScript and PHP for web development together with the CMS Joomla!. I also have knowledge in Java for Android development. I have also developed some small software using Ruby on Rails, Delphi, AngularJS, Lua and Céu (as a freelancer or for graduation works, for example).

2. **Are you familiar with the Lua programming language? Have you developed any projects using Lua?**  
    I used Lua, together with Love.2d framework, in a programming languages course in the University. The games developed as class projects are available in GitHub.

    I also have experience in Céu. I started to learn about Céu in reactive programming course in the University where I learned about Arduino programming with Céu-Arduino and native language, and the usage of Céu to develop SDL applications (with Céu-SDL). In this course I developed some works available in GitHub.

    Recently, I started to learn about Céu-Marker and pico-Céu. This study resulted in small project available in GitHub, that consists of a pico-Céu application that communicates with an Arduino via Serial port. The Arduino controls the movements of an object in pico-Céu application and produces a sound for each interaction. This object can be moved by computer keyboard too. In this case, the pico-Céu sends a message to Arduino via Serial port, which emits a sound using a buzzer. One video of the running application can be seen in YouTube.

3. **Have you developed software in a team environment before? Any projects with actual users?**  
    Yes. I worked in the development of AudioLab Geo, a locative media application for Android and Web. The developer group were composed by four members: three responsible for Android application and myself, responsible for the web application (front end and back end) and database.
    The app is in production phase available through this link and in Google Play Store.

4. **What kinds of projects/software have you worked on previously? (anything larger than a class project: academic research, internships, freelance, hobby projects, etc.)**  
    I worked in development of AudioLab Geo in its web version. The project consists in a georeferenced application. The app is in production phase and one article about it was submitted for an academic workshop. I have also been working on a website (using Joomla!) for our local laboratory.

5. **Are you (or have you been) involved with any open source development project? If so, briefly describe the project and the scope of your involvement.**  
    No.

## PROJECT
1. **Did you select a project from our list? If yes, which project did you select? Why did you choose this project? If you are proposing a project, give a description of your proposal, including the expected results.**  
    No, I didn’t selected a project from Lab Lua’s list. 

    The objective of my proposal is to provide an easy-to-install, up-to-date integrated environment for Céu-Arduino and pico-Céu development. Céu is a synchronous reactive language, with supports concurrent lines of execution and broadcast communication through events. The environment issues events to the applications, with responds immediately. It’s recommended to interactive apps such as games, and targets from desktops to embedded systems. Exploring this last flexibility, the language has some variations, such as Céu-Arduino and pico-Céu, a version o Céu meanted to visual and interactive applications.

    In the proposed approach, a developer can use the same source code to implement an application that runs on an Arduino (using Céu-Arduino) and on a computer (using pico-Céu), also supporting communicating between the two sides.

    This project will create a product that helps the learning of Céu, and that can be used in the classroom. Also, for education purposes, we will create a tutorial in portuguese and english as well as six examples distributed in multiple difficulty levels to explore all the Céu-Arduino and pico-Céu functionality. Lastly, the installer (Céu-Maker) and the documentation will be upgraded to last version of Céu-Arduino and pico-céu, offering to the user an update documentation and development environment.
